# AI Text Generator

This is a simple Flask application that provides an input window for the user to ask questions and uses a modified script to generate responses from an AI model.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed.
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install Flask aiohttp
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or copy `flask_app.py` and `templates/index.html` to a new folder.
2. Run the Flask application by executing `flask_app.py`:

```bash
python flask_app.py
```
3. Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
4. Enter your question in the input window and press "Generate" to receive a response generated by the AI model.

## Note

This application is built on top of a script that connects to an AI model using websockets. Make sure you have a running websocket server that the script can connect to. The current server address is set to `127.0.0.1:7860`. If your server is running on a different address, update the `server` variable in the `run()` function in `flask_app.py`.
